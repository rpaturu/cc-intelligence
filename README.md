## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. **Configure your API connection:**
Edit `.env.local` with your cc-orchestrator1 API details:
```env
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api-gateway-url.com
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

4. **Start the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `VITE_API_ENDPOINT`: Your cc-orchestrator1 API Gateway URL
- `VITE_API_KEY`: Your API key for authentication
- `VITE_USER_POOL_ID`: AWS Cognito User Pool ID
- `VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`: AWS Cognito User Pool Client ID
- `VITE_DEV_MODE`: Enable development mode features (optional)

### Authentication Configuration

The application uses **AWS Cognito** for user authentication with proper loginId management:

interface SalesIntelligenceResponse {
  insights: {
    companyOverview: CompanyInsights;
    painPoints: string[];
    keyContacts: Contact[];
    competitiveLandscape: CompetitiveIntel;
    talkingPoints: string[];
    dealProbability: number;
    // ... more fields
  };
  sources: string[];
  confidenceScore: number;
  generatedAt: Date;
  requestId: string;
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build for Production
